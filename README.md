# ox: Online X-Terminal

## Overview

ox is a highly _UN_secure but awesome way to get terminals open on your
machine from anywhere in the cosmos (with internets).

Just run the server and browse to get your xterm up in your browser.

## Installation (core)

Installation is a big pain due to the dependencies, this is being worked on
feverishly right now by teams of engineers so expect a fix soon.

So no instrcutions for now, but please let me know if you love OX!!!
